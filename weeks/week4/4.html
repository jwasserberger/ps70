/week four: microcontroller programming
    </pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>This week was a continuation of my kinetic sculpture from <a href="https://jlhansen9.github.io/PS70/weeks/week3/3.html">last week</a>. My Alexander Calder inspired mobile, was now ready for a microcontroller.</p>
  
  <p>In anticipation of my final project, I wanted to start to play with audio. The idea for this week was based on the ballerina music box, also taking a cue from Katie Merriam's kinetic sculpture. I wanted audio to play and a microphone to start the motor.
  </p>

  <p>This week we had the L9110 H Bridge Power Driver and an Arduino Uno. I wanted to add the Adafruit MEMS Microphone Breakout SPW2430 to receive an audio signal and Digital Write to initiate the motor.</p>
