  1. keyboard w/ pre-loaded templates and contextual understanding
</pre>
<pre style="color: white">
  - i really, really, really hate writing the same emails over and over again 

  - one of the worst elements of my life, actually

  - i'm in the recuiting process right now and cannot describe to you the hatred i have for wrote email copying

  - so, i'd like a tool to help me do that


  what i want to build is a keyboard with two main functions. 

    1. i want the "keyboard" to be able to recieve manually inputted templates, so the user could hit a single key and an entire piece of text would appear
      this is the simple version, and pretty straightforward to do - just a bunch of advanced macros (or at least the same line of thinking)

    2. eventually, if i'm smart enough, i'd like the keyboard to be able to understand contextually what someone is typing, and autofill the rest
      for example, if the keyboard detects the word "internship," "summer 2026," or "offer," it knows it's probably something recruiting related and has a bunch of templates ready to go.

    2a. ideally this expands far beyond just emailing but that's the start
