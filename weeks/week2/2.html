      i choose to make the lego block from one of the 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A">recommended tutorials</a>. 
      this short tutorial covered a lot of most useful basics to fusion. my favourite new 
      function, that I hadn't used before, is shell, which hollows out a surface to a certain thickness. 
      definitely will save this model for when we get to 3d printing. I foresee a lego paper weight.

      i chose two objects from home to model: one of my kitchen knives and a wok. 
      these objects were interesting to me because the geometry seemed doable in fusion 
      but not so complicated that I couldn't do it.

    i wasn't able to capture all dimensions using calipers so had to just estimate 
    dimensions based on general proportions. i felt pretty good with how it turned out. 
    a couple of key details that i wasn't quite able to capture was: (1) the handles 
    and their pins on the internal side of the wok. (2) the exact tapering of the knife blade
    because of the blend of curved and straight taper.

      your fun fact for the week is that the milk crate was invented in australia in the 1950s. 
      as a proud australian who consumes an above average amount of milk, i wanted to make my own.
      it represents indestrucible multi-functional industrialisation to me, so i wanted to channel
      that energy into PS70. more stylish and modern versions have been made by companies like 
      hay (see photo below).

      following this weeks lab, i had an idea for modelling teeth using a rectangular pattern 
      but i wanted something slightly sturdier. instead i decided to model teeth to fit into 
      slots. i modelled this in fusion as five different panels to create a box without a lid.
      the parameters came in handy when i got to the laser printer and realised the sizing was 
      off. i had to rescale and tweak but thankfully it worked out in the end. i also learnt my
      lesson about allowing time for the laser cutter queue!
