  While I had already skipped ahead and printed something for my kinetic sculpture. This week I played with an object that might be useful for later weeks.
</p>

<p>
  In anticipation of the molding exercise, I chose to print a small bunny taken from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:752379#google_vignette">Thingiverse</a>. I'm really loving 3D printing and producing models in Fusion. It was quite easy grabbing something from Thingiverse and printing. PrusaSlicer for generating gcode and printing is so striaghtforward. Fusion takes some adjusting but once you get on a roll, it's quite enjoyable.
</p>

<p>A direct copy of the STL for Ducky the bunny is <a download href='week5/Ducky.stl'>here</a>.</p>

  <p>
  Photogrammetry was not an easy process. Using the Revopoint 3D scanner I scanned a bust of <a download href='week5/Caesar Head.stl'>Julius Caesar's head</a>. This was only after trying to scan other objects, including my house key and glasses, that all proved to be too shiny and reflective for the camera.

<p>
  With help from Cassia, it then took a lot of time to manually clean up the point cloud after the scan picked up the ground surface for each angle at which the bust was scanned. The point cloud then ended up being 60MB so maybe it wouldn't have been best to just do two scans of the bust, not three.
