  For CNC this week, I got my idea from a instagram ceramicist called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/somthings2021/?hl=en">@somthings2021</a>. He makes really cool platters for different small food items. Using that, I wanted to make my own version in wood on the CNC to be used as a charcuterie board.

<p>
  I tried to replicate the handmade imperfections of somthings2021 work in Fusion (which was surprisingly difficult) adding asymmetries and irregularities across different depths. A copy of the dxf is <a download href='week8/charcuterie.dxf'>here</a>.

<p>
  The CNC did a wonderful job. The only issue was that I used plywood and it exposed some not so pleasant inner layers and the glue binding them. Not sure if its food safe...

<p>Moving onto molding I tried something food related again but this time using the bunny model <a href="https://jlhansen9.github.io/PS70/weeks/week5/5.html">from Week 5</a>! The goal was to create a unique ice cube to be had in a whiskey glass.</p>

<p>I scaled the model, printed in 3d and then used food safe silicone to cast it. I hot glued "Ducky" the rabbit onto a small wooden slat, sprayed Ducky in lubricant, cut the top off a plastic cup, and then dunked Ducky into a cup full of silicone.</p>

<p>
  I let the mold sit about 24 hours. Removal was not easy, using an ice cream stick to separate the silicone from Ducky. It took a lot of force and I was very nervous about ripping the mold, particularly around the ears where there was an opening. However, once it was out it was done!
</p>


<p>
  I then took it home, cleaned the mold thoroughly, filled it with water and put in the freezer. And look what I got!

<p>
  Was very pleased with how it turned out, however needs a few more rinses before it's food safe! To make removal easier, I do splash the mold with room temperature water and it pops right out.
