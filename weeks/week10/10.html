/week 10: machine building & end effectors - the pipe robot
    </pre>

  <p>Week 10 and 11 were dedicated to the pipe robot.</p>

  <p>The Mission: Build a robot to identify a blockage down a 4 inch sewer pipe somewhere in the depths of the Science Center.</p>

  <p>I was on the Locomotion team with Sam and Katie Mueller.</p>

  <p>A super fun challenge but very ambitious. Coordinating with other small groups proved difficult with different schedules and meeting times.</p>

  <p>We as a small Locomotion group got along well, focusing on the motor and chassis. Other groups considered steering, controls, video feed, and location sensing.</p>

  <p>Getting the motor itself working was easy, wiring up a XIAO-ESP32. All other components were complicated including gears, axles and wheels.</p>

  <p>We did several iterations on the front and back axles fitting to the metal servo motor frame to be used for steering. The lego set in the lab proved to be really useful for prototyping, sizing and getting a sense of wheel arrangements. Establishing constraints was a key part of the process and understanding the challenges what other groups were facing.</p>

  <p>Determining the maximum size dimensions for height and width within the tube were tricky as we could adjust the shape of the robot, often elongating to make thinner. This later became a problem for turning as the robot was too long.</p>

</p>

  <p>We decided to put the stepper motor on the back axle due to space constraints for the front facing camera. We also required a significant amount of on board processing and wiring, to then be hitched to a feeder cable relaying back to the controller.</p>

  <p>After two weeks of progress Nathan stepped in and further developed the model improving on the gear and wheel arrangement. With some minor tweaks to the 3D model we handed over our work to him.</p>

  <p>We didn't get to test it as a group but it definitely was a fun exercise, although challenging! Maybe not do a full wide group project though with a tight deadline next time.
