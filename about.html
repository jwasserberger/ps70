    <p>
      i grew up in sydney, australia. for my undergrad, i studied civil engineering becoming involved in  
      sustainability and water infrastructure. after graduating, i worked as a dams and hydropower 
      engineer in sydney and london. five years and a pandemic later, i needed a change. 
      i wanted to find more creative and rapid ways of building technology to solve problems for others. 
      that led me to the <a href="https://mde.harvard.edu/">design engineering program</a> at harvard. ps70 is a chance 
      for me to learn the skills i wish i had been taught in undergrad!
    </p>
    <p>
      at home, i spend my time doing something related to food, wine, music, basketball, design and architecture. 
      at school, i'm doing something related to sustainability, climate adaptation, waste, regenerative agriculture, and soil health.
